        <p>
          I put strong emphasis on having a clear understanding in the client's needs before even starting. Of course, there might be some features that will be done or patched along the way, since you can always change your mind and want other behaviours.

          Also, I might suggest prioritize a task over another because it might imply reusable code that the project would benefit on the long run.

          I am used to having daily calls or written discussions about the progress. Feedback is the key to success if you ask me. I am a flexible person, I take notes, advice and responsibility as needed.</p>
